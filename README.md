# React State Management Lab

This project is a **React** application set up with **Vite** for faster development and modern tooling. It serves as a lab to practice and explore various state management techniques in React, such as `useState`, `useReducer`, `Context API`, or any external libraries you may integrate.

## Project Overview
This lab focuses on building and practicing state management patterns and best practices in React. The application uses **Vite** as the development environment, which provides:
- Lightning-fast hot module replacement (HMR)
- Minimal configuration for React and CSS

---

## Features
- **State Management Exploration:** Use `useState`, `useReducer`, or Context API.
- **Fast Development Environment:** Vite setup with fast refresh enabled.
- **ESLint Configuration:** Pre-configured linting for clean and consistent code.

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd react-state-management-lab-main
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed, then run:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the development server:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open the app:**
   Vite will display a local development server URL, usually [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173). Open it in your browser.

---

## Scripts and Commands

- **`npm run dev`**: Start the development server with HMR.
- **`npm run build`**: Create a production-ready build.
- **`npm run preview`**: Preview the production build locally.
- **`npm run lint`**: Lint your code with ESLint.

---

## Usage

Explore different state management techniques by creating components and experimenting with:
- **useState**: For simple state handling within a component.
- **useReducer**: To manage more complex state with actions.
- **Context API**: Share state across multiple components without prop drilling.
- **External Libraries (Optional)**: You can integrate libraries like Redux or Zustand.
